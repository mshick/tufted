# Tufted

Tufted is a set if [remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark) and
[rehype](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype) plugins, plus a
[Tailwind Typography](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin) theme
that provides a richer reading experience for HTML generated from markdown.
Tufted's features are inspired by [Tufte CSS](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/)
and the design principles of [Edward Tufte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Tufte).

Tufted was created as the article style for [my website](https://shick.io) so
you can see it in action over there.
